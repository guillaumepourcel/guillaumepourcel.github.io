## courses

I am assisting Herbert Jaeger in his courses **Neural Networks for AI** (B.Sc.) and **Machine Learning** (M.Sc.) at the University of Groningen. See [here](https://www.ai.rug.nl/minds/teaching/) for more details.

I also served as a TA for the PhD-level [Spring School on Control Theory and Reinforcement Learning: Connections and Challenges](https://www.cwi.nl/en/events/cwi-research-semester-programmes/spring-school-control-theory-and-reinforcement-learning/), where I gave a tutorial on function approximation for RL.

## workshops & outreach

Co-organizer of a 48-hour workshop to recruit students at Arts et Métiers, focusing on the design and production of a 3D printed foot prosthesis inspired by work at the Bio-mechanics Institute Georges Charpak. Managed and assisted 4 groups of 5 students each.

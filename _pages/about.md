#### PhD student at the University of Groningen

I am interested in explanations of the human mind, engineering of unconventional computing artifacts, and where the two overlap.

My Ph.D. is on non-digital computing theories in the [MINDS group](https://www.ai.rug.nl/minds/){:target="\_blank"}. These theories are developed to be relevant for brains, minds, and future non-digital microchips.  I am currently working on [conceptor](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2671), a technique to unlock new types of control of high dimensional non-linear (neural) dynamics. I am funded by the European project [PostDigital](https://postdigital.astonphotonics.uk/){:target="\_blank"}. 

Before starting my Ph.D., I completed the [Arts et Métiers](https://artsetmetiers.fr/en){:target="\_blank"} engineering school with a specialization in [Neuroscience](https://www.bme-paris.com/program/master-2/bioengineering-and-innovation-in-neurosciences-bin/){:target="\_blank"}. I also obtained a master’s degree in Cognitive Science at École Normale Supérieure ([Cogmaster](https://cogmaster.ens.psl.eu/en){:target="\_blank"}). During my studies, I did two 6-months research internships, one with [Mehdi Khamassi](https://pages2.isir.upmc.fr/mkhamassi/?lang=en){:target="\_blank"} on Reinforcement Learning, one with [Axel Cleeremans](https://axc.ulb.be/){:target="\_blank"} on metacognition.

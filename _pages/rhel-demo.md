## RHEL Demo Overview

Use the video element below to showcase the RHEL workflow. The example assumes the video is stored at `assets/videos/rhel-demo.mp4`.

<video controls preload="metadata" style="width: 100%; max-width: 960px;">
  <source src="/assets/videos/rhel-demo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

## Demo Notes

Describe what happens in each stage of the recording so viewers know what to look for. You can mix normal markdown with raw HTML if you need more control over the layout.

- Phase 1: System provisioning and package setup.
- Phase 2: Service configuration and validation tests.
- Phase 3: Result overview and next actions.

## Writing Equations

Inline math uses single dollar signs, for example $E = mc^2$ will render within a sentence.

Display math uses double dollar signs on separate lines:

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0}
$$

If equations are not rendering, enable MathJax by including `mathjax: true` in the page front matter or confirm that `_includes/scripts/mathjax.html` is loaded in your layout.
